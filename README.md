# GameTimeApp

A project that me and three other memebers developed. It is an app that allows you to stay up to date on the latest NBA scores. We've made
it so that the user is in control when they want to notified based on multiple criterias, ie. time left in the game, the score difference,
and a favorite team. The app obtains its updates from an API through polling to update the game data at a very fast rate. 

Check out the app!
